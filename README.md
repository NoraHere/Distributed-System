I was not familiar with GitHub, so I only started to commit after I finishing all coding part of lab1.
I recalled some prior versions, but only few of them were stored. So there won't be too much commit history to check.
And after submit all, I found I should extract to .tar.gz type. So I re-commit last time to upload the right type of file.
I wish it won't be too confusing for check.
